### VS Code stuff

Where i work, everybody uses VSCode, so we share can mainly
- Share important configurations, (especially project specifics)
- Recommend extensions
- repetitive stuff like imports or so, we create snippets or when its good when things are standardized, like, the way we may import some package, or else (ex: if we refactor, we find more easily with find & replace);
